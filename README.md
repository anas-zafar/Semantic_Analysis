# Semantic_Analysis

Semantic analysis is a challenging problem in Natural Language Processing to understand
people’s subjective opinions. The challenging task is to analyze the results without being biased
if people use sarcasm in their statements. In order to correctly understand people’s true intention,
being able to detect.

Sarcasm is critical. We have applied Linear Support Vector Clustering to identify whether a
sentence is sarcastic or not. When we enter a sentence the program calculates the tf idf values
and based on different features we have used and it provides us with the relevant output. The
Linear Support Vector Clustering that we have used gives a good accuracy.
